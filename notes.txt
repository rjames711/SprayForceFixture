Application freezes around 700-800 datapoints when running for 100 seconds
when running 10 second intervals froze around 15 or 16th run (1500 to 1600)
works again when clear graph button is pushed. 

need to try:

Form1.Invalidate();
or
Form1.Refresh();

at a data speed of 40 per second 10 minute test (600 second 24000 datapoints)
took 608 seconds. UI was slow to update at end but did end with correct number of 
points and updated throughout. Says 53 MB memory. Did not lower when I exported data or cleared graph. Oddly now its
starting with about 41 MB

at 10 dps UI is updating at regular rate for at least the first 60 seconds. at 600 seconds seems to be updating at 
2-3 times per second. Missed the ending but it looked like it was keeping somewhat better time (within 3 seconds) than the last
test.
